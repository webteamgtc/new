They can go long, which means buying a currency pair with the expectation that its value will increase, or they can go short, selling a currency pair with the expectation that its value will decrease.

Risk management is crucial in forex trading, as it can be highly volatile and leveraged, meaning traders can control a larger position size with a relatively small amount of capital, but this also increases the potential for both gains and losses. Successful forex trading requires a solid understanding of the market, trading strategies, and risk management techniques",

It is advisable, from time to time, to call on the business premises to see if it appears to be, prima facie, conducting itself within the description given to the GTC E.g. manufacturer, Producer. hedger, retail trader, etc. It should be noted that corporate accounts are one of the most likely vehicles for money laundering.",
